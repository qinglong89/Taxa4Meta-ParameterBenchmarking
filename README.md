# Taxa4Meta-ParameterBenchmarking

Scripts here are for benchmarking of taxonomic accuracy and seqeunce clustering accuracy using simulated amplicon data of NCBI 16S RefSeq.

Testing on IdTaxa random & repeat sequences and RDP 16S sequences (unclassified at family level) is used for benchmarking taxonomic over-classification.

Scirpt for benchmarking QC methods for raw sequence filtering/trimming.
